HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. CSS is what adds style to those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!
Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as programming languages, but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, because they are only concerned with presenting information. They are not used to program any logic.

HTML: Content & Layout
HTML is a language that determines how documents and web pages are displayed in a web browser, the language for the building blocks of any website.

CSS: Styling and “Look & Feel”
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a popular style sheet language that determines how a document created in HTML is styled (colors, font styles, layout and responsive features).

JavaScript: Interactive Elements
JavaScript allows you to change CSS and HTML elements on your website after the site has been loaded, which gives you the ability to make your site more interactive and engaging for users.
