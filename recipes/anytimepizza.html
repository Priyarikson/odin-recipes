    <h3>Make your own pizza topped with green peppers, mushrooms, or other vegetables.</h3>
    <p>This recipe is one of those snacks that you can make when you get pizza cravings. You just need a fresh loaf of bread, a really good pizza sauce (I would definitely recommend a Homemade pizza sauce.) and some veggies.</p>
    <p>Bread Pizza is a quick, instant and tasty variation of pizza recipe made on griddle or tawa or pan. The bread base mimics the pizza base with veggie toppings. Of course the taste of bread pizza is different than the original veg pizza.</p>
