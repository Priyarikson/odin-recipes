    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds chicken pieces (skin removed)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 cup celery (washed and chopped)</li>
        <li>3 carrot (large, scrubbed, thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>4 cups noodles, dry</li>
        <li>thyme or sage (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash hands with soap and water.</li>
        <li>Thaw frozen chicken in refrigerator (about 24 hours), or thaw in microwave just before cooking soup.</li>
        <li>Place chicken pieces in large kettle. Cover completely with water. Cover, bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>With soap and water, carefully wash your hands and any counter surfaces and equipment that came in contact with raw chicken.</li>
        <li>Remove cooked chicken pieces from broth with tongs or slotted spoon. Cool 10-15 minutes before separating bones from meat. Break meat into bite-size pieces. Remove any bones from broth.</li>
        <li>Remove fat from broth by skimming with spoon, adding and removing ice cubes, or blotting top of broth with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Put chicken meat, seasonings and vegetables into stock.</li>
        <li>Bring broth to a boil, cover, reduce heat and cook about 15-20 minutes on medium heat until sliced carrots are crispy-tender.</li>
        <li>Add noodles and boil uncovered for about 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up any noodles that might stick together. (One cup of dry noodles (1.5 ounce) makes one cup of cooked noodles).</li>
        <li>Ladle into soup bowls.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate or freeze leftovers within 2 hours of cooking. If refrigerated, use within 2 days. When reheating, bring to a boil.</li>
    </ol>
